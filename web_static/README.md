### Web static, what?

Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it's time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build step by step the front-end.

The first step is to "design" / "sketch" / "prototype" each elements:

- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything
